Django Blog Project

This project is a simple blog built with Django, created as part of my learning journey after mastering Python. It includes basic functionalities such as:

Creating, updating, and deleting blog posts.
A simple form for adding new posts.
Displaying posts in a user-friendly layout.
Basic structure to handle user inputs and form submissions, along with user permissions.
By building this project, I’m gaining hands-on experience with Django’s core features like models, views, templates, forms, and routing. This is a key step in learning how to develop web applications using the Django framework and its built-in tools.

The project helps me practice:

Django’s MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.
Handling user authentication and form validation.
Styling the application with simple HTML/CSS.
As I continue building the blog, I will also incorporate Django REST Framework (DRF) to enhance the project by:

Creating APIs to fetch blog posts, create new posts, and update or delete posts via HTTP requests.
Serializing models to convert blog post data into JSON format, making it accessible for external applications or frontend frameworks.
Authentication and permissions for handling secure API access, ensuring that only authenticated users can perform certain actions like creating or editing posts.
DRF Views and ViewSets to streamline API logic and allow more efficient CRUD operations for blog posts.
This blog project will evolve over time as I explore more advanced Django concepts and expand the features. Integrating DRF will help me deepen my understanding of building both traditional web applications and modern RESTful APIs using Django.
