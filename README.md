# Django Blog Project

This project is a simple blog built with Django, created as part of my learning journey after learning Python. It includes basic functionalities such as:

- Creating, updating, and deleting blog posts.
- A simple form for adding new posts.
- Displaying posts in a user-friendly layout.
- Basic structure to handle user inputs and form submissions along with user permissions.

By building this project, I’m gaining hands-on experience with Django’s core features like models, views, templates, forms, and routing. This is a key step in learning how to develop web applications using the Django framework and its built-in tools.

The project helps me practice:
- Django’s MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.
- Handling user authentication and form validation.
- Styling the application with simple HTML/CSS.

This blog project will evolve over time as I explore more advanced Django concepts and expand the features.
